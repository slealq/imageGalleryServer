```

## Output Format

### Enhanced Pose Data

The Ultralytics method extends the standard pose data format:

```json
{
  "image_path": "path/to/image.jpg",
  "pose_method": "ultralytics",
  "has_pose": true,
  "person_count": 2,
  "people": [
    {
      "person_id": 0,
      "landmarks": [x1, y1, x2, y2, ...],  // 34 values (17 keypoints)
      "pose_confidence": 0.85,
      "detection_score": 0.92,
      "visibility_scores": [0.9, 0.8, ...],  // 17 values
      "bounding_box": {"x1": 100, "y1": 150, "x2": 300, "y2": 500},
      "keypoint_format": "coco_17",
      "class_name": "person"
    }
  ],
  "additional_detections": [
    {
      "class_name": "bicycle",
      "class_id": 1,
      "confidence": 0.75,

  "pose_extraction_method": "ultralytics",
  "ultralytics_model": "yolo11s-pose.pt",
  "ultralytics_device": "cuda:0",
  "enable_object_detection": true,

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Speed | Multi-Person | Additional Objects | 3D Landmarks | GPU Support |
|--------|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| MediaPipe | Fast | Limited | No | Yes | Yes |
| Detectron2 | Moderate | Excellent | No | No | Yes |
| **Ultralytics** | **Fast** | **Excellent** | **Yes** | **No** | **Yes** |

## Use Cases

### Sports Analysis
```yaml
pose_method: "ultralytics"
ultralytics_model: "yolo11m-pose.pt"  # Balance of speed and accuracy
enable_object_detection: true
object_classes: ["person", "sports ball", "tennis racket", "baseball bat"]
```

### Traffic Scene Analysis
```yaml
pose_method: "ultralytics"
enable_object_detection: true
object_classes: ["person", "bicycle", "car", "motorcycle", "bus", "truck"]
```

### Comprehensive Scene Understanding
```yaml
pose_method: "ultralytics"
enable_object_detection: true
object_classes: ["all"]  # Detect all COCO classes
```

## Advanced Features

### Feet Detection
While YOLO doesn't have dedicated foot keypoints, you can detect shoes/feet through object detection:

```yaml
object_classes: ["person", "shoe"]  # If custom model includes shoes
# Or use ankle keypoints from pose data (keypoints 15-16 in COCO format)
```

### Custom Models
You can use custom-trained YOLO models:

```yaml
ultralytics_model: "path/to/custom_model.pt"
```

### Batch Processing
The service automatically handles batch processing with progress tracking:

```
ðŸŽ¯ Processing 1000 images with Ultralytics
Extracting poses: 100%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ| 1000/1000 [02:15<00:00, 7.4img/s]
Success: 950/1000, Rate: 95.0%, People: 1200, Avg: 1.3/img, Objects: 450
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Download**: First run downloads the model automatically
2. **GPU Memory**: Use smaller models (nano/small) for limited GPU memory
3. **CUDA Errors**: Ensure PyTorch CUDA version matches your CUDA installation
4. **Class Detection**: Verify class names match COCO dataset format

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use appropriate model size** for your hardware
2. **Enable GPU acceleration** with `use_gpu: true`
3. **Filter object classes** to reduce processing overhead
4. **Adjust confidence thresholds** to balance accuracy vs. speed

### Memory Management

For large datasets:
```yaml
sample_percentage: 10  # Process 10% of images for testing
confidence_threshold: 0.7  # Higher threshold = fewer detections
```

## Integration with Other Services

The Ultralytics pose extraction integrates seamlessly with other services:

- **Clustering Service**: Use pose landmarks for similarity clustering
- **Embedding Service**: Generate embeddings from detected objects
- **Similarity Service**: Compare poses and detected objects

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- **Custom object classes** training support
- **Temporal pose tracking** across video frames
- **3D pose estimation** using depth information
- **Real-time streaming** support
- **Advanced filtering** based on pose quality metrics
